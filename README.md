# Pathogenic Variant Finder

A high-performance Rust tool to identify pathogenic variants from VCF files using ClinVar and 1000 Genomes data.

## Overview

This tool analyzes VCF (Variant Call Format) files to identify potentially pathogenic genetic variants by cross-referencing them with the official ClinVar database and incorporating population frequency data from the 1000 Genomes Project. It supports both GRCh37 (hg19) and GRCh38 (hg38) genome builds.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Variant Detection**: Identifies variants classified as pathogenic, benign, or of uncertain significance in ClinVar
- **Population Frequency Integration**: Incorporates allele frequencies from 1000 Genomes (global and by population)
- **High Performance**:
  - Parallel processing using Rayon's work-stealing thread pool
  - Efficient file handling with memory-mapped files
  - Parallel chunk downloads for reference databases
- **Rich Annotation**: Provides comprehensive annotations including:
  - Clinical significance classifications
  - Gene information
  - Molecular and functional consequences
  - Mode of inheritance if available
  - Citations and additional evidence
- **Automatic Reference Data Management**: Downloads and maintains necessary reference databases
- **Advanced Reporting**: Generates detailed CSV reports and summary statistics files
- **Flexible Variant Selection**: Configurable inclusion of pathogenic, VUS, and benign variants

## Installation

There are multiple ways to install the Pathogenic Variant Finder:

### Option 1: Using the installer script (recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SauersML/pathogenic.git
cd pathogenic

# Run the installer script (you might need to make it executable first)
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# Or run it directly with bash
bash install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. Build the release version of the tool
2. Give you options to create a symlink in a directory in your PATH
3. Allow you to run the tool simply as `pathogenic` from anywhere

### Option 2: Manual installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SauersML/pathogenic.git
cd pathogenic

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# The binary will be available at target/release/pathogenic_variant_finder
# You can run it directly:
./target/release/pathogenic_variant_finder -b GRCh38 -i your_variants.vcf

# Optional: Create a symlink for easier access
sudo ln -sf "$(pwd)/target/release/pathogenic_variant_finder" /usr/local/bin/pathogenic
```

### Option 3: using docker
A Dockerfile is provided to run Pathogenic Variant Finder in a container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t pathogenic .
# run the example, this will load 1000 Genomes and clinvar the first time
mkdir clinvar_data # to persist the download
docker run --rm -it -w /data -v $(pwd):/data pathogenic  pathogenic -b GRCh37 -i /data/exdata/test.vcf.gz
```

### Development Container Users

If you're using the provided Dev Container, the tool will be automatically built and made available as `pathogenic` in your PATH when the container starts.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the tool simply as:

```bash
# Basic usage (pathogenic variants only)
pathogenic -b GRCh38 -i your_variants.vcf

# Include Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS)
pathogenic -b GRCh38 -i your_variants.vcf -v

# Include benign variants
pathogenic -b GRCh38 -i your_variants.vcf -n

# Include both VUS and benign variants
pathogenic -b GRCh38 -i your_variants.vcf -v -n

# Disable markdown report generation
pathogenic -b GRCh38 -i your_variants.vcf --markdown-report=false
```

### Command-line Arguments

- `--build`, `-b`: Genome build, must be either "GRCh37" (hg19) or "GRCh38" (hg38)
- `--input`, `-i`: Path to the input VCF file (can be uncompressed or gzipped)
- `--include-vus`, `-v`, `--vus`: Include variants of uncertain significance in the output
- `--include-benign`, `-n`, `--benign`: Include benign variants in the output
- `--markdown-report`, `--md-report`: Generate markdown report (enabled by default, use `--markdown-report=false` to disable)

## Output

The tool generates the following output files in the `reports/` directory:

### 1. CSV Report File

The CSV report contains detailed information about all identified variants with the following columns:

- Chromosome, Position, Reference Allele, Alternate Allele
- Clinical Significance
- Is Alt Pathogenic
- Significance Category (pathogenic, benign, vus, conflicting)
- Gene
- ClinVar Allele ID
- Clinical Disease Name (CLNDN)
- Genotype
- Review Stars (0-4 star rating system)
- Allele frequencies:
  - ESP, ExAC, and 1000 Genomes Project (TGP)
  - Population-specific frequencies (AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR, SAS)
- Detailed annotations:
  - Molecular and Functional Consequences
  - Mode of Inheritance
  - Preferred Values
  - Citations
  - Comments and Family Data
  - Record Status
  - Description
  - Date Last Evaluated
 
Depending on available data, many of these fields may not be available.

### 2. Statistics Text File

A companion statistics file summarizing the analysis settings and results:

- Analysis settings (input file, genome build, variant types included)
- Command used to run the analysis
- Total variants processed and reported
- Number of unique genes
- Counts of each variant classification type
- Distribution of allele frequencies across populations

### 3. Markdown Report File

A comprehensive, human-readable markdown report that includes:

- Analysis settings and command used
- Summary statistics with variant counts by category
- Table of contents linking to different sections
- Detailed variant information organized by clinical significance
- Variants grouped by gene with sortable tables
- Detailed information about each variant including:
  - Location, DNA change, and genotype
  - Clinical significance and disease associations
  - Population frequencies
  - Mode of inheritance and other annotations
- Understanding section with explanations of terms

The markdown report is generated by default but can be disabled using `--markdown-report=false`.

### Output File Naming

Output files follow this naming convention:
```
[input_filename]_[analysis_type]_[timestamp].csv
[input_filename]_[analysis_type]_[timestamp]_stats.txt
[input_filename]_[analysis_type]_[timestamp].md
```

Where `analysis_type` indicates which variant types were included in the report.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The tool automatically downloads necessary reference databases:
   - ClinVar VCF (GRCh37 or GRCh38)
   - ClinVar summary TSV for deeper annotation
   - 1000 Genomes frequency data

2. **Variant Processing**:
   - Parses the user's VCF input
   - Filters for variants present in the sample's genotype
   - Matches variants against ClinVar based on selected variant types
   - Integrates 1000 Genomes allele frequency data
   - Adds detailed annotations from ClinVar summary data

3. **Output Generation**:
   - Sorts variants by chromosome and position
   - Outputs comprehensive CSV with all annotations
   - Generates a statistics file summarizing the analysis
   - Creates a detailed markdown report with interactive sections (unless disabled)

## Logging

The tool maintains a log file (`pathogenic.log`) that captures all processing steps and can be useful for troubleshooting.

## Usage
Do not use this for clinical purposes.
- I might have written a bug in the code.
- Your input file might be wrong.
- Your input file may be right, but different somehow than the files I tested on.
- I did not test this extensively. In fact, there are no unit tests. (Though I did run an integration test via other tooling.)
- You might have done something wrong. For example, you entered the wrong genome build.
- The data in the database might be wrong about pathogenicity of some variant.
- You don't know how to interpret the results.
- You don't know how to interpret mode of inheritance.
- You don't know how to assess evidence for or confidence in pathogenicity.
- Your input file is imputed or has spurious genotype calls.
- Many other reasons not listed here.

What can you use this for?
- Finding potentially pathogenic variants to follow up on via other means.
